# Deployed Topology - osasinfra-ipv6

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the osasinfra-ipv6 DT, then
please the [README](../../examples/dt/osasinfra-ipv6/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory `dt/osasinfra-ipv6/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../examples/dt/osasinfra-ipv6/kustomization.yaml) in
the examples directory of osasinfra-ipv6 topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
