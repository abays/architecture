# Deployed Topology - Nova/nova01alpha

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the nova01alpha based DT, then
please see the 
[README](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova01alpha/README.md) in the examples
directory.

This directory ,`dt/nova/nova01alpha/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/dt/nova/nova01alpha/edpm/nodeset/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory of nova01alpha topology, reference it by path as a
component. It's contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to understand
how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
