# VA: SNO

If you are looking for information on how to deploy the SRIOV VA, then
please see the
[SNO README in the examples directory](../../../examples/va/sno/README.md).

This directory, `architecture/va/sno/`, exists so that the
[kustomization.yaml](../../../examples/va/sno/kustomization.yaml)
in the examples directory for the SRIOV VA, reference it by path as a
component. Its contents are likely uninteresting unless you want to
understand how kustomize was implemented in this repository.
